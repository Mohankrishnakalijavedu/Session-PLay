## Session-PLay

##Basic Forntend React Native code for the below task

##Implement a React Native application with a single screen. The screen should just show if the session is active or not, and have a button to toggle this variable.
  Assume the session is stored in a persisted reducer (use Redux, Redux-persist) variable called “isSessionActive: false/true”.
  The app should have the following two behaviors: 
   1. Logs out the user when the app is in the background state for more than 10 minutes. 
   2. Logs out the user when the app is closed.

## Please install latest node modules and run -- npm run web to check the out put in web mode
